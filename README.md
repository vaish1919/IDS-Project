## Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Project

Overview 

This project is a real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that analyzes network traffic to detect potential security threats using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. It leverages Python, Flask, SQL, and various ML models to identify malicious activities.

Features

- Real-time Traffic Monitoring

- Anomaly Detection using ML/DL models

- SQL Database for Logging and Analysis

- Web-based Dashboard using Flask

- Automated Alert System


Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python

- Frameworks: Flask, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

- Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn


Installation

- Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/IDS-Project.git
cd IDS-Project

- Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure the database in config.py.

Run the Flask application:

python app.py

Dataset

- Uses NSL-KDD or CIC-IDS-2017 dataset for training and testing.

Model Training

- Preprocess the dataset (data_preprocessing.py).

- Train the model (train_model.py).

- Save the trained model (.h5 or .pkl).

Usage

- Access Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:5000

- Monitor Live Traffic

- View Detected Anomalies


Future Enhancements

- Integration with SIEM platforms

- Implement Reinforcement Learning for adaptive threat detection

- Deploy on Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)
